V fix the glitch with multi-explosions behind the power stations
V proper Z-ordering for infrastructure and projectiles
V flak overheating
V visual hint about flak barrel overheat (make the barrel redish or whitish?)
V increase flak bullet spread when overheated (spread threshold, then increase)
V z-targeting to increase missile/drone precision
V precision drone attacks with explosions
V when in the main menu after game over, the Escape shouldn't start a new game
V scenario selection
V scenario common setup utils

> include debug scenarios when debugging
> configure the initial number of flaks
> waves (part of scenario life cycle)
> custom man pages with core design and structure
> define coordinate spaces
> normalize coordinate naming - relative (0-1), percentage (0-100) etc...

> scenario life cycle
> scenario success/fail conditions?
> end of the wave screen (with stat and infographics) and wave transitions

> game stat subsystem
> core sfx
> configurable idle autostart [45 - 90 - 180 - never]
