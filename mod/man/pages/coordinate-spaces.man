------------------------------------------

== Screen Coordinate Space

This coordinate space is defined by the actual browser viewport.

Absolute screen/canvas coordinates are used here,
originating from the top-left of the screen.


== Backdrop/CityScape Coordinate Space

This space is used to define the sun, the stars, the skyline, the grid
and all other background elemenets.


== Port Coordinate Space

It is defined by the city port camera that centers the x origin
at the middle of the screen and always pans width
to match _env.playfield.width_ (2000 by default)
with height dynamically adjusted according to the current aspect ratio.
That makes the camera viewport to pan from -1000 to 1000 horizontaly,



To simplify addressing in the arcade space, you can use:

* [crx(xP)](#./alt/crx) - translates percentage value into the x-coordinate, where 0 is the left edge and 100 is the right one
* [cry(yP)](#./alt/cry) - translates percentage value into the y-coordinate, where 0 is the bottom and 100 is the top
