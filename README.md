# Z-Alert: Anti-Ballistix

## Concept

**The Theme: Aerial attack on a modern city**

**The Goal: Protect the infrastructure at all costs!**

* Control anti-aircraft crews and knock off incoming projectiles
* A spiritual successor of Missile Command
* Local co-op
* Relax with the family during Air Raid Alerts
* The city lights in the background show the state of the infrastructure - keep the lights glowing!
* Meta: buy ammunition, upgrade air defences
