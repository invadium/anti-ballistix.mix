# Z-Alert: Anti-Ballistix


### Welcome to Anti-Ballistix, a Missile Command inspired game about modern anti-aircraft defence!

> This is the only game that I know of coded exclusively during air raid alerts.
> Late evening/night alerts are usually long, so I start my coding stream
> if there is no immediate threat and move slowly with my coding.

## Concept

**The Theme: Aerial attack on a modern city**

**The Goal: Protect the infrastructure at all costs!**

* Control anti-aircraft crews and knock off incoming projectiles
* A spiritual successor of Missile Command
* Local co-op
* Relax with the family during Air Raid Alerts
* The city lights in the background show the state of the infrastructure - keep the lights glowing!
* Meta: buy ammunition, upgrade air defences
