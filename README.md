# Z-Alert: Anti-Ballistix


### Welcome to Anti-Ballistix, a Missile Command-inspired game about modern anti-air defence!

> A unique game coded exclusively during air raid alerts.
> Late evening/night alerts are usually long, so I start my coding stream
> if there is no immediate threat and move slowly with my development.

## Concept

**The Theme: Aerial attack on a modern city power infrastructure**

**The Goal: Protect the power stations at all costs!**

* Control anti-air crews and knock off incoming projectiles
* A spiritual successor of Missile Command
* Local co-op - play with your friends and family
* The city lights in the background show the state of the infrastructure - keep the lights glowing!
* Meta: buy ammunition and additional protection, upgrade air defences and repair the power stations with your accumulated bonuses
